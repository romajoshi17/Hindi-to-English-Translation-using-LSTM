# Hindi-to-English-Translation-using-LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a neural machine translation (NMT) system using an encoder-decoder architecture with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary goal is to translate sentences from English to Hindi accurately. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to map input sequences in English to their corresponding translations in Hindi, capturing the nuances and complexities of both languages.
## Objectives
- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess a dataset of English-Hindi sentence pairs for training.
- Model Development: Construct an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model for translation tasks.
- Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance.
- Inference: Implement functionality to translate new English sentences into Hindi.
- Analysis: Assess the model's accuracy and identify areas for improvement.

## Methodology
1. Import Libraries: The project utilizes essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow Keras for building and training the neural network.
2. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded from a text file where each line contains an English sentence and its Hindi translation. The data is then cleaned and structured for training.
3. Tokenization: Unique characters from both languages are extracted, sorted, and indexed to facilitate one-hot encoding of sentences.
4. Input Data Preparation: Three arrays are created to hold the encoded input data for the encoder, decoder input data, and decoder target data. One-hot encoding is applied to represent each character as a binary vector.
5. Model Architecture: An encoder-decoder model is built using LSTM layers. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates hidden states, while the decoder uses these states to produce the translated output.
6. Training: The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy as the loss function and trained on the dataset using specified hyperparameters. A validation split is used to monitor performance during training.

## Results
The machine translation model achieved an accuracy of 80%, successfully translating English sentences into Hindi with reasonable fidelity. This performance highlights the potential of neural networks in overcoming language barriers and facilitating communication across different linguistic backgrounds.

## Future Work
- Enhance model performance by experimenting with different architectures such as Transformers.
- Incorporate attention mechanisms to improve context handling in translations.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse sentence structures and vocabulary.
- Implement post-editing features to refine translations based on human feedback.
