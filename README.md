# Hindi-to-English-Translation-using-LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a neural machine translation (NMT) system using an encoder-decoder architecture with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary goal is to translate sentences from English to Hindi accurately. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to map input sequences in English to their corresponding translations in Hindi, capturing the nuances and complexities of both languages.
### Objectives
- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess a dataset of English-Hindi sentence pairs for training.
- Model Development: Construct an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model for translation tasks.
- Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance.
- Inference: Implement functionality to translate new English sentences into Hindi.
- Analysis: Assess the model's accuracy and identify areas for improvement.
